Material Design Color Palette For Gimp
======================================

We have been loving the color palette that Google Has Prescribed for its [Material Design Language](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). However we realized that we couldn't find a readymade Palette that we can use in GIMP / Inkscape.

So we at [KiSSFLOW](http://kissflow.com) created one for the community. Download the file and import it as a Palette in GIMP and then you are good to go.


How To
======
##Gimp
####(Tested on 2.8.2)
Open the Palettes window with: `Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Palettes`. Once opened, click on `configure this tab` on the top right corner of the new window and select `Palettes Menu > Import Palette...`. Select the option `Palette file` and choose the downloaded file [Material-Design.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auzias/gimp-material-design-color-palette/master/Material-Design.gpl).
