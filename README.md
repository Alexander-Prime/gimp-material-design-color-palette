Material Design Color Palette For Gimp
======================================

We have been loving the color palette that Google Has Prescribed for its [Material Design Language](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). However we realized that we couldn't find a readymade Palette that we can use in GIMP / Inkscape.

So we at [KiSSFLOW](http://kissflow.com) created one for the community. Download the file and import it as a Palette in GIMP and then you are good to go.
